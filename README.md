# CHALLENGE
### Attitude Estimation Exam

The task was performed using the divide and conquer paradigm, which allows a modular programming that divided the problem as follows:
-> Reading Input File
-> Handling read data
-> Estimation algorithm
-> Estimate writing

### Estimation Algorithm:
Based on the document: Tilt Sensing Using Linear Accelerometers equations 37 and 38 were used to develop the estimate of the roll and pitch angles, taking into account the units of the elements used.

### The algoritm generates the following file:
estimate_roll_pitch.log
Following the pattern:
    <roll,pitch>

### Steps to compile the software:
  - Used libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h, math.h
  - It is recommended to place the input file in the same project folder
  - Run the file: Proyecto 1.exe
  - The output file will be generated in the folder that the file was hosted
